# Docker Project

Hello guys, recently we had done our docker training under the guidance of VIMAR sir. He's a great teacher, he always inspire us, and he enlighten us with his knowledge. 

In docker training we had done many cool things, before this training I had no knowledge of DOCKER, like what is docker??, and after this training, all the docker concepts are clear. It's really intresting. This initiative under the IIEC RISE is great, awesome, and fabulous. I appreciate it

About My Project : Sometimes the CLI(Command Line Interface) is so complex to work with, specially for those guys who don't want to work with it. But there is a another option for these guys who don't like CLI and for client side also, GUI(Graphical User Interface). And I've use tkinter(GUI) here. Just a simple Desktop application for wordpress. I've give two options, first one is Manual Config, You have to put every thing manually.

- mysqlContainerName > MySQL Container name
- mySQLUsername > Username
- mySQLPassword > User's password
- mySQLDatabase > DB name
- createVolWordpress  > Volume name for Wordpress
- wordpressContainerName > Wordpress Container name
- portNumber > ex. 8080
- portNumber2 > ex. 80
- mysqlContainerName > MySQL Container name

but In automatic config, you don't have to put all these thing, Just one click start and one click stop
