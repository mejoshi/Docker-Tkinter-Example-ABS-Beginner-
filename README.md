# Docker Project

About My Project : Sometimes the CLI(Command Line Interface) is so complex to work with, specially for those guys who don't want to work with it. But there is an another option for those guys who don't like CLI and for client side also, GUI(Graphical User Interface). And I've use tkinter(GUI) here. Just a very simple Desktop application for wordpress. I've given two options, first one is Manual Config,and another one is automatic config.

1. Mannual Config

- mysqlContainerName > MySQL Container name
- mySQLUsername > Username
- mySQLPassword > User's password
- mySQLDatabase > DB name
- createVolWordpress  > Volume name for Wordpress
- wordpressContainerName > Wordpress Container name
- portNumber > ex. 8080
- portNumber2 > ex. 80
- mysqlContainerName > MySQL Container name

2. Automatic COnfig

but In automatic config, you don't have to put all these thing, Just one click start and one click stop. I've used docker compose here.

Here is the screenshot 1, - As i said, you have two options, manually or automatic config.
